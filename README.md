# Word Compare

### By **Phil Mass**

## Description

_This project takes two words or phrases and compares them to see if they are anagrams. It disregards punctuation and spaces, and does a quick validation on the words. It also checks whether they are antigrams (they share no letters), or reports which letters they have in common._

This project was created as an independent project for Epicodus, Ruby Course, Week 1

## Setup and Installation

* Clone the project from https://github.com/philrmass/word-compare.git to a local directory
* In a terminal, run the anagrams script with:
 * > ruby anagram_script.rb
* In a terminal, go to the project directory and run the tests with:
 * > rspec
