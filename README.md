# Word Compare

### By **Phil Mass**

## Description

_This project takes two words or phrases and compares them to see if they are anagrams. It disregards punctuation and spaces, and does a quick validation on the words. It also checks whether they are antigrams (they share no letters), or reports how which letters they have in common._

This project was created as an independent project for Epicodus, Ruby Course, Week 1

## Setup and Installation

* Clone the project from https://github.com/philrmass/word-compare.git to a local directory
* In IRB on a terminal, create an instance and check for anagrams with:
 * >**word_compare = WordCompare.new()**
 * >**word_compare.anagram("Can't rely on it., "certainly, NOT!!")**
* To run the tests go to the project directory in a terminal and enter:
 * >**rspec**
